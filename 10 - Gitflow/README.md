## 10 - Gitflow

### An Introduction

We've covered a lot of complex topics in the last couple of sections... and as you can probably imagine, things like branching, merges and rebases become even more complicated once they have to be coordinated in a team full of numerous developers.

This is where branching strategies and Git workflows come in to the equation.
They are a pre-defined workflow of rules that the team abide by to enforce consistency.

I also want to say now that I am not by any means saying Gitflow is the strategy teams should follow or that it is undoubtedly the best strategy out there.

It is an incredibly popular strategy because it catered very well for a world prior to the current Dev Ops heavy world, prior to the discovery of practices such as Continuous Integration, for example. So there is value in being aware of how it worked.

It is a Git workflow strategy that was first presented by Vincent Driessen in 2010 (10 years ago, wow!).
At first sight, it will look quite complex but over time, it becomes less scary.

I won't explain it myself on here, because Vincent himself has done a much better job than I will ever be able to.
