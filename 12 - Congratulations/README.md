## 12 - Congratulations

### Well done

You've not only had the endurance to sit through this entire crash course, but you also endured a rant about Trunk Based Development!

Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed with the number of commands you've just used. Most of them are just a google away... or even better, just a Git GUI away!

I like GitHub Desktop & TortoiseGit, however SourceTree is another great program alongside GitKraken, Fork & the most obvious, the GUI that comes with installing Git itself.

I tend to use a GUI application for the mass majority of Git tasks bar probably blame, rebase & probably stash. There's no shame in that!

Last but not least, if there are any commands that you regularly use in your daily workflow but think have been missed out of this crash course, feel free to submit a pull request containing changes to accommodate for it :)
